# Existing standards for representing languages & countries in the Internet
<!-- # Existing standards for country & language codes -->

### Daniel Staśczak

Made with <https://github.com/gnab/remark>

???

- This will be mostly in the context of working w/ internalization…
- … because that's the context where I learned about all of this recently.

# Devtalk challenge

by Mateusz Wójcik, Marcin Tubisz, Przemysław Grzeszczak.

---

# Devtalk challenge, cont.

### What is it?

- A long-term mini-hackathon connected with a devtalk's topic.
- Create a solution for any problem connected with the current  
    topic—**Existing standards for representing languages & countries in the Internet**. The sky is the limit!

--

### Rules

- **Duration?** 1 month.
- **Who?** Individually or in a group.
- **How to participate?** Register team on Slack—`#devtalk-challenge`.
- **Presentation?** 2023-03-27 16:00 Devtalk Challenge Teams Presentation.
- **Rating?** TBD in the next few days but a similar form to the regular hackathon.
- **Who can rate?** Everyone!
- **Prices?** 200 Sparky points per participant + big mystery prices for best solutions!

---

# Devtalk challenge, cont.

If you have any questions feel free to ask on the `#devtalk-challenge`.

---

# What will you learn?

1. Why there's so many standards and what are the basic differences between them.
--

1. The difference between `en` and `en-us`, `en-gb`, `en-au` .small[(~~the last one is upside down~~)].
1. The difference between `en-us` and `en-US` and `EN-US` and `en_US` 🤯.
1. The difference between `zh-cn` and `zh-Hans` (representation for the Simplified Chinese, kind of).
1. If `eng` is even a valid language code.
--

1. Tricky things that you should watch out for while working with language codes.

--
1. Why country name or flag emoji are _not_ a good indicator of the language.
1. Why you shouldn't allow users to define an arbitrary named locales in the app.


???

- why some apps use `en`, while others use more specific `en-us`/`en-gb`/`en-au`/etc
- what's the difference between 5 characters `zh-cn` and 6 characters `zh-Hans` (both signify Simplified Chinese, kind of)
- why there's so many standards for languages and what are the basic differences between them
- if `eng` is even a valid language code
- what are some tricky things that you should watch out for while working with language codes
- why country name or flag emoji are _not_ a good indicator of the language
- why you should never allow users to define an arbitrary named locales in the app or I will be very very sad

---

# Why?

- Because I've spent a _lot_ of time to research that.
- There is a lot of non-obvious details and good/bad practices.
- That's a pretty interesting topic! 🤓

---

# Some extra context

- I was working on the DeepL.footnote-char[¹] API integration.
- This is like the Google Translate…
- … but AI-powered.
- Great for longer text—articles, essays~~, and any other homework~~.

# ISO 639

- A set of standards for representing **languages**.
- Created by the _International Organization for Standardization_.
- The first, currently withdrawn edition is from 1967.
- Defines standards from ISO 639-1 to ISO 639-6.footnote-char[¹].

.footnote[
.footnote-char[¹]ISO 369-6 was withdrawn, though.
]

---

# ISO 639-1 AKA Alpha-2 codes

Two-letter codes, e.g.:
- `en` (English).
- `pl` (Polish).
- `de` (German).
--


This also includes some less widely-known languages, e.g.:
- `se` (Northern Sami).
- `sa` (Sanskrit, an ancient language).
--


Can we use it to define a regional variant of a language, e.g. American or British English?
--

**No**.

---

# ISO 639-2 AKA Alpha-3 codes

Three-letter codes, e.g.:
- `eng` (English).
- `pol` (Polish).

--

It splits into:
- ISO 639-2/B (bibliographic code), derived from the English name of a language, e.g.:
    - `ger` (German).
    - `fre` (French).
--

- ISO 639-2/T (terminological code), derived from the native name of a language, e.g.:
    - `deu` (German).
    - `fra` (French).

--

ISO 639-2/T resembles the respective code of ISO 639-1 and **is favored**.

---

# ISO 639-3

Three-letter codes.

It extends the ISO 639-2 with an aim to cover all known natural languages, e.g.:
- `ase` (American Sign Language).

However, it is _not_ a superset of ISO 639-2 (it misses language collections and bibliographic codes).

---

# ISO 639-4 and 639-5

- ISO 639-4 covers implementation guidelines and general principles for language coding.
- ISO 639-5 defines Alpha-3 codes for (a tiny portion of) language families and groups.

---

# Case-sensitivity

> ISO 639-2 recommends use of the language codes in lower case, but they should be considered case-insensitive and are unique codes regardless of case.
>
> —<cite><https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/faq.html#21></cite>

Therefore, `en == En == EN`, although we should use `en`.

--

**Note**: remember to use `CIText` field in `Django` for that, then!

---

# A quick summary

English | `en` | `eng` | `eng` | `eng`
Polish | `pl` | `pol` | `pol` | `pol`

Which one should be preferred?

**Difficult to say**.

# ISO 3166-1

- A standard for representing **countries and their subdivisions**.
- Created by the _International Organization for Standardization_.
- The first edition is from 1974.

# ISO 15924

- A standard for representing **scripts** (writing systems).
- Maintained by the Unicode Consortium.
- The first edition is from 2004.
- Four-letter codes.
- Where possible, derived from ISO 639-2 (surprisingly, preference is given to the bibliographical codes).

# IETF language tag AKA BCP 47

- A standard for representing **human languages in the Internet**.
- Created by the _Internet Engineering Task Force_ and maintained by the _IANA Language Subtag Registry_.
- Combines all of the previous standards.
- Composed of one or more subtags separated by hyphens (`-`).

---

# e.g.

.pure-table.pure-table-bordered.pure-table-striped[
Language | IETF language tag
- | -
American English | en-US
British English | en-GB
Australian English | en-AU
European Portuguese | pt-PT
Native language of @dcapeletti | pt-BR
Serbian written in the Cyrillic | sr-Cyrl
Serbian written in the Latin | sr-Latn
Zürich German | gsw-u-sd-chzh
]

---

# Case-sensitivity

> Subtags are not case-sensitive, but the specification recommends using the same case as in the Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are UPPERCASE, script subtags are Title Case, and all other subtags are lowercase.
>
> —<cite><https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag#Syntax_of_language_tags></cite>

Therefore, `en-us == En-uS == EN-US`, although we should use `en-US`.

---

# Language Subtag Registry

# Hyphen or underscore?

**Opinion**: You can use hyphen if you don't have some peculiar use-case.

# Chinese simplified vs. traditional

.left-column[
Simplified Chinese can be represented as:
    - `zh-CN`.
    - `zh-Hans`.

`zh` -> Chinese  
`CN` -> China  
`Hans` -> Han script (simplified variant)

Traditional Chinese can be represented as:
    - `zh-TW`.
    - `zh-Hant`.

`zh` -> Chinese  
`TW` -> Taiwan  
`Hant` -> Han script (traditional variant)

**The preferred are `zh-Hans` and `zh-Hant`.**

---

# Algerian Arabic

Can be represented as:
    - `ar-DZ`.
    - `arq`.

`ar` -> Arabic  
`DZ` -> Algeria  
`arq` -> Algerian Arabic (in ISO 639-3)

---

# Algerian Arabic, cont.

> When a distinct language subtag exists for a language that could be considered a regional variety, it is often preferable to use the more specific subtag instead of a language-region combination.

**The preferred is `arq`.**

# Using flag emoji to indicate a language

🇵🇱 -> Poland -> Polish (`pl`)?

--

🇺🇸 -> USA -> English (`en`) or American English (`en-US`)?

🇬🇧 -> Great Britain -> English (`en`) or British English (`en-GB`)?  
Does that include Scottish, Welsh, and Irish English too, or not?

🇨🇦 -> Canada -> English (`en`) or Canadian English (`en-CA`)  
or French (`fr` ) or Canadian French (`fr-CA`)?

# Allowing users to define locale by themselves

--

The problem we want to solve:

In our CMS, we want to allow users to define an arbitrary locales they want to support in their apps.

--

Users should be able to define a (display) name for the front-end and a clear identifier for the public API.

--

There's a lot of languages in the world, so we need to provide enough flexibility to the users.

--

Okay then, let's allow the user to define a locale as:
```python
class Locale:
    name: str  # an arbitrary string
    code: str  # an arbitrary string
```

---

# Allowing users to define locale by themselves, cont.

What can go wrong?

--

This can lead to `Locale(name="Swedish", code="se")`, which is not true (`se` is Northern Sami).

--

Or `Locale(name="American English", code="usa-en")`, which is not a valid IETF tag.

--

Or `Locale(name="English", code="en")`, good luck with guessing if that's supposed to be American or British English!

--

Or `Locale(name="Chinese", code="zh")`, good luck with guessing if that's supposed to be Simplified or Traditional Chinese!

Or `Locale(name="🇨🇳", code="zh")`, the same as above.

--

**Yes, this is a real-world data**.

---

# Allowing users to define locale by themselves, cont.

What to do instead?

--

**Validate the user's input**, obviously.

Provide a full list of languages (both names and _valid_ IETF codes) that the user have to _choose from_.

.left[<img src="images/input_select_en.png">]

To preserve the flexibility, allow the user to define an optional display name.

For the public API, just use a lower-case IETF code (e.g. `en-us`)—it's URL-safe.

---

# Let's recap!

1. Why country name or flag emoji are _not_ a good indicator of the language.
--

1. Why you shouldn't allow users to define an arbitrary named locales in the app.
