# Presentations

This is a repository for storing various presentations of mine, e.g. for devtalks I gave while working for the [Apptension](https://github.com/apptension/).

## How to run

Each subdirectory contains an `html` file. Simply open it in the browser, e.g. by using:

```shell
$ open gnupg/gnupg_presentation.html  # macOS
$ xdg-open gnupg/gnupg_presentation.html  # Linux
```
